Recursive Feedback Collapse in Symbolic Systems Under Self-Referential Load
Overview
Welcome to the repository for the Recursive Feedback Collapse in Symbolic Systems Under Self-Referential Load theorem! This theorem proposes that symbolic processing systems (both biological and artificial) will experience a nonlinear collapse in semantic coherence when they exceed a critical threshold of recursive self-referential load. This collapse manifests as hallucination, logical contradiction, or semantic drift, driven by the saturation of recursive feedback loops.

This work has cross-disciplinary implications for AI safety, cognitive modeling, and the study of symbolic reasoning systems. It offers insights into the limits of recursive computation and the resulting failure modes when systems are pushed beyond their capacity for logical self-reference.

Key Concepts:
Symbolic Abstraction Systems: Systems that rely on symbolic representations and recursive reasoning (e.g., neural-symbolic hybrids, human cognition, transformer models).

Critical Recursion Threshold (

 ): The point at which the system‚Äôs internal recursive feedback loops become unsustainable, leading to semantic collapse.

Semantic Coherence Metric

Testable Predictions:
AI Models (Transformers, VAEs): Recursive prompt chains or deep symbolic recursion will lead to sudden coherence decay, measurable by embedding drift and entropy increase.

Neural-Symbolic Models: Increasing recursion depth will cause loss of abstraction integrity, leading to semantic drift and feedback saturation.

Human Cognition: Paradoxical chains (e.g., Curry‚Äôs paradox, Yablo‚Äôs paradox) will induce delays or meta-confusion under cognitive load, measurable by reaction time and semantic retention.

Entropy and Coherence Decline: As recursive depth and feedback intensity increase, entropy and semantic coherence will degrade in both AI and human models.

What We Need: Collaboration and Feedback
This repository is open for collaboration from researchers, practitioners, and theorists across various fields. We are particularly interested in contributions from AI safety experts, neuroscientists, philosophers, and anyone interested in exploring the implications of recursive symbolic collapse in cognitive and computational systems.

Areas for Collaboration:
Theoretical Refinement:

How can we improve the mathematical formulation of recursive feedback and collapse behaviors?

Are there additional variables or mechanisms we should include in the model?

Empirical Testing:

Can we empirically measure collapse in transformers, neural-symbolic models, or human cognition under recursive self-referential load?

How can we track entropy and semantic coherence during recursive overload in real-world systems?

Applications to AI Safety:

What practical steps can we take to prevent recursive hallucination or feedback collapse in AI models?

How can we design robust feedback mechanisms to avoid collapse under extreme recursive conditions?

Cross-Disciplinary Contributions:

Does this model offer insights into cognitive overload or symbolic reasoning failures in humans?

Can the model be applied to complex systems, such as economic models or social dynamics, where feedback loops and symbolic reasoning play a critical role?

Test Design:

Are there alternative tests or new approaches to track the collapse condition and semantic degradation in both AI and human models?
