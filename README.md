# 🔄 Recursive Feedback Collapse Theorem

## Overview

This repository presents the **Recursive Feedback Collapse Theorem**, which describes a failure mode in symbolic and neural systems under high levels of recursive self-reference.

When a system recursively feeds back into its own outputs—without external grounding or entropy regulation—it can exceed a structural threshold and enter a state of **semantic instability** or collapse. This model defines measurable indicators, collapse phases, and simulation strategies relevant to both artificial intelligence and human cognition.

## 🔢 Key Terms

- **Recursive Feedback**: When a system’s output is used as input in a repeated or looped fashion.
- **Symbolic Entropy**: The degree of unpredictability or incoherence in symbolic outputs.
- **Semantic Collapse**: A breakdown in logical or symbolic consistency.
- **Self-Referential Load**: The symbolic or computational burden created by recursive references to the system’s own state or previous outputs.

---

## 📉 Collapse Indicators

- Sudden drop in semantic coherence scores (e.g., BERTScore)
- Increase in output entropy or randomness
- Divergence of latent representations (e.g., embeddings)
- Feedback loops generating contradictions, paradoxes, or hallucinations
- Pronoun instability or self-referential confusion in language models

## 🧪 Simulation and Measurement

### Applicable Systems
- Autoregressive transformers (e.g., GPT)
- Recursive neural-symbolic systems
- Logic engines or cognitive agents with feedback loops

### Measurement Tools
- Mutual Information estimation (MINE, CLUB)
- Entropy tracking across recursion steps
- Embedding drift via cosine distance
- BERTScore and BLEU for coherence evaluation

## 🧠 Human Cognition Parallel

- Recursive paradox loops (e.g., “This sentence is false”)
- Thought spirals and working memory overload
- Symbolic overload in recursive tasks (e.g., proof by contradiction, paradox chains)

## 🛠 Applications

- **AI Safety**: Detection and prevention of runaway recursive feedback
- **Cognitive Modeling**: Simulation of paradox-induced overload
- **Language Architecture**: Limiting recursion depth or symbolic self-reference
