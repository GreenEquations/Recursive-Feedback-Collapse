# ðŸ”„ Recursive Feedback Collapse Theorem

## I. Theorem Statement

Recursive feedback in symbolic systems introduces increasing semantic pressure with each iteration. When this feedback exceeds a critical thresholdâ€”without external grounding or entropy regulationâ€”the system transitions into a collapse state characterized by loss of coherence and increasing output entropy.

Let:
- **C(t)**: Coherence score at recursion depth t
- **E(t)**: Symbolic entropy
- **R(t)**: Recursive feedback factor (feedback cycles per unit time)
- **Î¸f**: Collapse threshold for feedback recursion

If:

    R(t) > Î¸f

Then:

    dC/dt < 0     and     dE/dt > 0

This indicates the onset of semantic collapse under recursive load.

## II. Collapse Characteristics

1. **Symbolic Drift**  
   Recursively processed symbols deviate from original meaning or structure.

2. **Entropy Accumulation**  
   Outputs become increasingly disordered and less interpretable.

3. **Instability Onset**  
   Contradictions, hallucinations, and semantic inconsistencies begin to emerge.

4. **Pronoun Confusion (Language Models)**  
   References to self or others degrade in clarity or consistency.

## III. Empirical Indicators

- Decline in BERTScore or BLEU across recursion depth
- Embedding drift (cosine similarity decrease)
- Spike in Shannon entropy
- Mutual Information drop between recursive outputs
- Self-referential hallucinations or logical contradictions

## IV. Simulation Design

### Models
- Autoregressive language models (e.g., GPT, LLaMA)
- Recursive symbolic logic agents
- Chatbots or systems with self-referential prompts

### Metrics
- Semantic coherence scores (BERTScore, BLEU)
- Mutual Information estimation (MINE, CLUB)
- Cosine similarity of latent embeddings
- Î”Entropy per recursive step

### Visualization
- UMAP / t-SNE of recursive embedding states
- Coherence vs. recursion depth plots
- Collapse curve approaching R(t) > Î¸f

## V. Human Cognition Parallel

- Paradox loops (e.g., "This sentence is false")
- Cognitive fatigue in recursive reasoning tasks
- Working memory overload and breakdown in symbolic tracking

## VI. Applications

- **AI Reliability**: Prevent collapse in autoregressive models
- **Cognitive Modeling**: Simulate recursive overload in symbolic reasoning
- **System Design**: Implement grounding checks to regulate feedback
- **Safety Research**: Design monitoring tools for entropy build-up
